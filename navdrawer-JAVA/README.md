![](NavigationDrawerLayout_Handle_NavDrawerMenuEvents_Android_Github_gif.gif)

## Introduction

To show how to add navigation drawer to a layout & how to handle navigation drawer menu items.




#### Note :

* We can also add navigation drawer by simply selecting the **Navigation Drawer Activity** using a templet.

* I hav done it from scratch.

* Key thing to remember about setting up the drawer is that it's a wrapper around the rest of our activity layout.


# Thank You.
